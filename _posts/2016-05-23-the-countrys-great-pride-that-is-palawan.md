**The Country's Great Pride that is Palawan**

Palawan is known all over the world as the Philippine's last ecological frontier. Home of lofty mountains, unspoilt rainforests and the world's longest underground river, Palawan is situated between Mindoro Island and North Borneo. It harbours a vast expanse of tropical rainforests and marine wilderness; Sloping mountain ranges run the length of the mainland, with thick trees providing sanctuary to many rare fauna species. Equally astounding are the rich marine life and coral reefs which are strictly protected from exploitation.
